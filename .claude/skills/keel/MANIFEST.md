# Keel Manifest — v3.3.0

One file, three tables, one purpose: looking ONLY at this file, a session can tell (1) whether a project contains everything Keel requires at its current phase, (2) which skill files changed in which Keel version — so after an update it knows exactly what to re-read, without interpreting the changelog — and (3) what concrete actions each version asks of an existing project (the reconciliation delta).

**When to read this file:** after EVERY skill update (it is the post-update reconciliation's first input — see `references/project-state.md`), and any time a full parity audit is wanted. **Authority rule:** the phase references are the contract; this manifest is the verifiable index of them. If they ever disagree, the reference wins and the mismatch is a release bug — fix the manifest.

## Table 1 — What a Keel project must contain

Verification is phase-aware and condition-aware: read the project card and phase status in `docs/PROGRESS.md`, then check that every row required AT OR BEFORE the current position (whose condition the project meets) exists. Anything missing joins the reconciliation's batched plan — whatever version introduced it. Rows marked "conditional" depend on a recorded choice (project card) or a project trait; their absence is only a gap when the condition holds.

| Path (in the project) | What it is / template source | Required from | Condition |

Project-card lines that must exist (inside `docs/PROGRESS.md`): the full card per the `references/project-state.md` template, including `Keel portability:`, `Assistant config:` (introduced v1.10.0 as `Claude config:`; renamed with the tools list in v3.0.0), `Keel baseline:` (since v1.10.0), `Client budget:` and `User guide:` (both since v2.0.0), `Docs theme:` (since v3.2.0 — set when the theme is vendored at Phase 6), and `Models:` (since v3.3.0 — the role→model map, set when the assistant-config package includes agents; `n/a` otherwise).

## Table 2 — Skill files and the Keel version that last changed them

After an update, re-read `SKILL.md`, the current phase's reference, and THIS file always; beyond that, the files to re-read are exactly the rows whose version is NEWER than the project's `Keel baseline:`. Rows are the `keel/` tree — what travels in the embedded copy.

## Table 3 — Per-version actions on an existing project (the reconciliation delta)

What the reconciliation APPLIES, version by version, for every version newer than the project's `Keel baseline:`. "None structural" means the version changed skill behavior only — re-reading per Table 2 is enough. Versions before v1.10.0 predate the baseline mechanism; for those, the Table 1 parity audit covers everything.

| Version | Actions for an existing project |
|---|---|
| v1.10.0 | Add `Claude config:` and `Keel baseline:` card lines; offer the optional Claude Code config package once. |
| v1.11.0 | Lock block gains its version stamp — refreshed by the normal lock-freshness check. |
| v1.12.0 | None structural (the manifest itself was introduced, skill-side). |
| v1.12.1 | Ensure `.keel-update-check` is an unconditional `.gitignore` entry. |
| v1.13.0 | None structural. |
| v2.0.0 | Ask the `Client budget:` question if it was never asked and add the card line. On runnable projects, generate `scripts/keel-verify` and add seed/reset to the playground at (or after) the Phase 5 scaffold. If the Claude config package is accepted and the forge has CI, offer the CI workflow. If the project has UI, the next handoff audit or re-audit uses the evidence-table `docs/BUILD-SPEC.md` §1. If Phase 7 is done, set the PROGRESS.md position to "maintenance" and work per `references/maintenance.md`. If website intent is recorded, plan `launch-report.md` and `operations.md` at the next launch or freshness pass. On runnable projects, the debug-log system with its on/off switch (Phase 5 scaffold spec) is added at the next sprint kickoff or maintenance change. The reconciliation itself ASKS whether to create the full end-user guide now (`guide/` — the Phase 6 section, with its language and packaging questions) and records the answer on the new `User guide:` card line; creating it on a released project is a normal maintenance change. The lock-block stamp refreshes through the normal freshness check. |
| v2.1.0 | None structural. Behavioral: nothing is ever written into `docs/design/design-handoff/` again — user-generated assets and acquired fonts go to the PROJECT's tree (contract rule 10). If the current handoff already contains foreign files, move each to its correct home (project tree or `docs/`) at the next Phase 4 touch, restoring the wholesale-replaceable state. |
| v3.0.0 | The multi-assistant generalization. Ask once which assistants work on this repo (if never asked) and rename the project card line `Claude config:` → `Assistant config: [none / rules / rules+agents / full] (tools: ...)`, keeping the recorded acceptance level. Create the missing `AGENTS.md` lock mirror (same block, same stamp) through the normal lock-freshness refresh; if the user works with Gemini CLI, ask its mirror question (a `GEMINI.md` copy, or `context.fileName` in `.gemini/settings.json`) and record the pick. If the skill is embedded, add the second tree so `.claude/skills/keel/` + `.agents/skills/keel/` both exist (verified full-copy protocol; they sync together from now on). If the assistant config package is accepted, offer materializing the containers for the newly named tools from the same recorded sources (per `references/assistant-config.md`); add the accepted tools' personal files to `.gitignore` (`AGENTS.override.md`, `.gemini/.env`, `.gemini/tmp/`); if the pre-commit gate is installed, update its embedded-skill exemption to cover `.agents/skills/*` (a recorded gate change). At the next Phase 7 touch, extend the export-ignore set to every generated assistant config tree. |
| v3.1.0 | If the assistant config package is accepted: regenerate `code-reviewer` (new comments check) and the `code-style` rule (new comments line) in every capable container from the same recorded sources. Where the `User guide:` card line is yes and `guide/` exists, generate the `guide-qa` subagent in each capable container at the next Phase 6 or maintenance touch. Nothing else structural. |
| v3.2.0 | Add the `Docs theme:` card line (n/a until a theme is vendored). Where `User guide:` is yes and `guide/` predates the canonical theme (improvised HTML): at the next Phase 6 or maintenance touch, OFFER rebuilding `guide/` on the theme per `references/guide-theme.md` and ask the never-asked developer-portal questions (render `docs/`? ships or repo-only?), recording the answers — regenerating a released project's guide is a normal maintenance change. Regenerate `guide-qa` (new check 6 + inputs) in every capable container where it exists. |
| v3.2.1 | None structural — release-asset verification (Phase 7) and the theme fallback warning (`guide-theme.md`) are behavioral; re-reading per Table 2 is enough. |
| v3.3.0 | Add the `Models:` card line. If the assistant config package is accepted WITH agents (`rules+agents` or `full`): settle the role→model map (orchestrator / reviewer / mechanical) with the user per `references/assistant-config.md` ("Model binding"), record it as a D-entry and on the card line, and materialize each capable container's native model field at the next Phase 2-close or maintenance touch. If no agents (or the package is not accepted): set the card line to `n/a` and do nothing else. Nothing else structural. |

## Maintenance (part of EVERY release — no exceptions)

- Every file touched by a release updates its "Last changed in" row; a new file gets a new row; a removed file loses its row (noted in the changelog).
- If the release changes what a project must contain (new required file/directory, new project-card line, a condition change), Table 1 is updated in the same release — and Table 3 gets the release's action row (or an explicit "None structural").
- The header line of this manifest carries the skill version and is one of the FOUR synced version locations (frontmatter, SKILL.md heading, CHANGELOG.md, MANIFEST.md header) governed by the version change policy in `references/keel-maintenance.md` — never bumped without explicit user instruction. The repository `README.md` version line and the canonical lock-block stamp in `references/project-state.md` are kept in sync as part of the same release hygiene.
- Verifying this manifest against the release's actual diff is part of release hygiene for the skill itself: a stale manifest defeats its purpose. Run `python3 tests/lint-release.py` before tagging — CI runs it again on every tag.
